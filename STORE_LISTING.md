## Full Description

**The simple, powerful time tracker designed specifically for freelancers and independent contractors.**

Stop losing billable hours. Freelance Timer helps you accurately track every minute of client work, organize projects, and generate professional invoices—all from your phone.

### Time Tracking Made Simple
Start the timer when you begin working, stop it when you're done. It's that easy. Your time entries are automatically saved and organized by project, so you always know exactly how many hours you've worked.

### Project & Client Management
Create clients and projects with custom hourly rates. Assign time entries to specific projects and see at a glance how your time is distributed across different clients.

### Professional Invoicing
